# Cohort-Analysis-and-modeling-in-online-retail-using-machine-learning

*	Investigated the online retail dataset and did data cleaning.
*	Assessed the most and least expensive products
*	Overlooked the sales numbers, using different features like countries, products, customers
*	Performed Cohort Analysis to find the retention rate and for average sales quantity
*	Retention rate increased from 2010 to 2011 (45.3% to 45.7%)
*	Visualized how sales amount changed with time
*	Took a new online retail dataset and I again did clean and processed the data
*	Used FP-Algorithm to get frequent patterns from a portion of huge number of invoices in the dataset
*	Used mlxtend libraryâ€™s association_rule module to get the confidence metric, so I can sort them on that basis
